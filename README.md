This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Necessary Scripts

In the project directory, run:

#### `npm install`

To install all the packages necessary to start the application.

Then run,

#### `npm start`

Which will run the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Details about the project

I chose to use the following external packages when building this application.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for API requests/responses
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) for its Pagination and Modal components
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling

__Notes:__

I spent a lot of time working on this so for the most part, I believe I had the opportunity to clean up the majority of the things that came to mind while developing this, but one of the improvements I would surely make is fixing the aspect ratio of the images when the modal is open so that the images show more clearly. Another thing I'd do is make the pagination & query params on the **/search** page bi-directionally functional.
